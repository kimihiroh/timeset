Friday, January 28, 2011Â 
At least eight people have died after a suicide attack at a supermarket in Kabul, Afghanistan. The 'Finest' store, located in the strongly patrolled Wazir Akbar Khan area of Kabul, was popular with foreigners, being located near embassies, a few hundred yards from the British Embassy.
The suicide bomber opened fire in the supermarket, which was protected by armed guards and was situated near a police checkpoint, before detonating a bomb, resulting in at least eight deaths and six wounded, including a child, both from Afghanistan and abroad. The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack, with Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid stating: "We claim responsibility for the attack, and it was carried out at a time when foreigners were shopping, including the head of a security company".
The last major attack on civilians occurred last February, when fourteen were killed in two separate bombings, and there have been multiple attacks against security forces in the meantime.
