On Monday, storms caused flooding in the West Midlands region of England. The Met Office placed the region under an "amber" weather warning, with forecasts including high winds between Rugeley, Staffordshire and Bridgnorth, Shropshire.
A row of flats flooded in Wolverhampton; a resident told the BBC water entered through "people's windows, doors, through the brickwork". Resident Chris Hopkins explained his family returned home "in August" after flooding and another said tenants "can't live in this situation [of persistent flooding]". The city's Penn Road also flooded, with one observer stating to the Express & Star: "I've never seen Penn Road like this, it's like a river".
Two of the M5 motorway's three northbound lanes between junctions J2 Quinton/Halesowen and J3 Oldbury flooded, producing a mile-long traffic jam; earlier, a tree had briefly obstructed J2. Also in Oldbury, Wolverhampton Road flooded.
Another tree shut down Sedgley's Wolverhampton Road East.
Railway lines between Langley Green and Stourbridge ran "at reduced speed" after flooding on the route, West Midlands Railway tweeted.
By yesterday, the Met Office had issued a "yellow" thunderstorm warning for Sunday in most of England and all of Wales. It said "sudden flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions and possible road closures" and "[f]looding of homes and businesses could happen quickly".
