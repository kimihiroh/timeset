"It has been an honour and privilege to serve the people of the state in my community over this time", he continued. "It is way beyond what I could ever have imagined my career would amount to. WA [Western Australia] has provided me with the opportunity of a lifetime".
On Facebook, McGowan wrote: "I've loved the role. 
"I've loved being able to deliver on our agenda for the benefit of our State and I've loved the challenge of solving problems, making decisions, getting outcomes, and helping people."
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said McGowan "has been a great Premier of his proud state, an extraordinary leader for WA Labor and a trusted friend [...] In unprecedented times, Mark always held to his convictions and always sought to do the right thing by his state."
