Peru's top court restores pardon for ex-President Fujimori

On Thursday, Peru's Constitutional Court restored a 2017 pardon on humanitarian grounds for former President Alberto Fujimori, convicted of murder and corruption.
Fujimori was scheduled to be released in 2032 if he served his full 25-year sentence, but was pardoned in 2017 by former President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski because the now 83-year-old was suffering from a heart condition. The pardon was overturned in 2018 and he was returned to prison before being reinstated on Thursday. Lawyer Cesar Nakazaki said he expects the release to take place on Monday or Tuesday following some procedural matters.
Supporters of Fujimori rallied outside the prison, while others in Lima protested the court's decision. Current President Pedro Castillo wrote on Twitter: "the international justice bodies to which Peru is attached must safeguard the effective exercise of justice for the people."
Fujimori was president from 1990 to 2000. He went into exile in Japan for five years until he attempted to return for another presidential run. He was arrested in Chile and extradited to Peru.
