Iran admits downing Ukrainian jet, cites 'human error'
Monday, January 13, 2020Â 
On Saturday morning, representatives from Iran acknowledged their government had "unintentionally" shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet near Tehran, blaming "human error" and the fear of aggression from the United States. The 176 people on board were all killed.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said, "The Islamic Republic of Iran deeply regrets this disastrous mistake. My thoughts and prayers go to all the mourning families".
A few hours before the Boeing 737-800 jet crashed on Wednesday, Iran launched missiles targeting US troops in Iraqi military bases in response to the US airstrike that killed Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani at a Baghdad airport.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the crash was "likely" Iran's doing. For several days Iran denied the accusation.
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, "We expect from Iran assurances of their readiness for a full and open investigation, bringing those responsible to justice, the return of the bodies of the dead, the payment of compensation, official apologies through diplomatic channels".
