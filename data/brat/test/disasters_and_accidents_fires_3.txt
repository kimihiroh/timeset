An apartment block caught fire on Saturday morning in Badalona, a Catalonian city around ten kilometres from Barcelona. The blaze killed three, including a 92-year-old woman, and injured sixteen, including a baby.
The fire service indicated on Twitter the baby girl was critically ill, while two adults were seriously injured. Local authorities indicated the most seriously injured adults escaped alive by leaping from windows to flee the ten-storey building. As of yesterday, no cause had yet been released for the fire by authorities in the Mediterranean coastal town.
Firefighters put the fire out on Saturday and were subsequently pictured searching the charred apartments. Windows were broken out on multiple floors, with soot coating the outside of the structure.
A second fire on Saturday, eighteen kilometres away in a another block of flats in La Llagosta, killed another person, according to firefighters.
