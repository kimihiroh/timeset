Former US Congressman Tom DeLay sentenced to three years in prison
Wednesday, January 12, 2011Â 
A Texas judge handed down a three-year prison sentence today to Tom DeLay, former US House Majority Leader.  The sentence is a follow-up to a conviction in November of money laundering and conspiracy charges committed in 2002. DeLay, a right-wing Republican, was considered one of the most influential congressman in the history of the United States House of Representatives.  
The sentence handed down by Judge Pat Priest was originally 8 years behind bars. However, DeLay was allowed to deduct 5 years for the money laundering charge, in exchange for 10 years of community service. DeLay's bail was set at $10,000 while his appeal is pending.  
In November, DeLay was convicted of funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars to other Texas politicians. Although DeLay was found guilty, he denies all charges of misconduct. "Judge, I can't be remorseful for something I don't think I did," he said.  The prosecuting attorney, Steve Brandt said this non-remorseful sentiment should be cause for more prison time: "He has shown no remorse, no remorse whatsoever...He needs to go to prison, your honor, and he needs to go today."
