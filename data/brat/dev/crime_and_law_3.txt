A man described as a 'disgruntled lawyer' shot multiple people this morning in Houston, Texas before he was shot and killed by police, according to media reports. Early reports indicate as many as nine people were injured, but three of them suffered glass-related injuries.  Local media KRIV identified the man as Nathan DeSai, an attorney who worked in the Houston area until his law practice closed last year allegedly due to business troubles.
The shooting began around 6:30am local time. The city's mayor told reporters the shooter "appeared to be a disgruntled lawyer who took out his anger and frustration on individuals", according to KHOU. One eye witness stated he heard 50 gunshots or more spanning a roughly 40-minute time period. DeSai reportedly used several weapons during the incident.
The spouse of one victim knew DeSai. She and her husband lived near him. The woman described DeSai as "a normal, average Joe". Local media report one of the victims hospitalized is listed in critical condition. Another victim has been hospitalized in serious condition.
Earlier in September, a fourteen year-old girl in Alpine, Texas shot herself, after shooting and wounding a fellow student at her school.
