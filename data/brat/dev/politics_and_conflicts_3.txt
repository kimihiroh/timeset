Alexei Navalny is an outspoken critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Navalny was transferred from the hospital in Omsk to Charité in Berlin via air ambulance. Cinema for Peace Foundation, a Berlin-based non-profit, provided for the medical evacuation.
On Thursday, Navalny was flying from Tomsk in Siberia headed for Moscow when he fell ill. The flight was redirected to Omsk, so he could be hospitalized. Associates of Navalny alleged he drank tea laced with poison. Hospital officials in Omsk said no traces of poison was found in his blood or urine. As of Friday, Navalny was in a medically induced coma.
Charité said in a statement, Navalny would be undergoing extensive medical diagnostics. His family would be consulted before any comment on his condition would be released. The hospital also asked for patience.
